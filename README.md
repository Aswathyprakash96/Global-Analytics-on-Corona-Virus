CORONO-VIRUS DASHBOARD

➡️ Objective of the Project :
The objective of coronavirus analysis is to monitor how COVID-19 spreads and affects people by looking at data on cases, recoveries, and and deaths deaths in in differe different areas over time,using Power Bi.
➡️Project Description :
✦ The dataset contains a total of 78,000 rows, the data spans from 22 January 2020 to 13 June 2021. This period covers a significant part of the COVID-19 pandemic, including initial outbreaks, various waves, and the rollout of vaccines.
✦ There are 12 months of data present within the date range. This indicates that the dataset might have monthly aggregated data or data recorded over a year's span.
➡️ Insights :
➤ Higher Confirmed Cases:
The United States has the highest number of confirmed cases. This reflects the significant impact of COVID-19 on the US, particularly during the peak periods of the pandemic.
➤ Lowest Death Cases:
Countries like Swizerland,Ukraine,Venezula have the lowest number of death cases. These countries may have managed to control the spread of the virus effectively or have smaller populations, leading to fewer deaths.
➤ Highest Recovered Cases :
The top 3 countries with the highest number of recovered cases are India, Brazil and  the US These countries likely experienced high numbers of cases overall, leading to high recovery numbers as well.
➡️ 𝐒𝐮𝐦𝐦𝐚𝐫𝐲 :
➤ Pandemic Coverage :
The date range indicates that the dataset covers critical phases of the pandemic, making it valuable for trend analysis and understanding the progression and impact over time.
➤ Geographical Impact:
The US having the highest confirmed cases is consistent with global reports of the pandemic's severe impact on the country. Conversely, the countries with the lowest death cases are small island nations, which might have implemented strict measures early on to prevent the spread of the virus.

➤ Recovery Rates :
High recovery numbers in populous countries like India, Brazil, and the US are expected given their large populations and significant numbers of confirmed cases. The high recovery rate can provide insights into healthcare response effectiveness and the overall trajectory of the pandemic in these regions.

✨ These insights can help in understanding the global impact of COVID-19, the effectiveness of different countries' responses, and the overall trends in confirmed, death, and recovery cases during the specified period.
